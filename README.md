# Intel NPU - vlc player with generated subtitles by OpenAI-Whisper  

A python vlc player that transcribes subtitles while watching a video. The model used to automatically generate the subtitles is [Whisper, by Open-AI](https://openai.com/index/whisper). The default model version is the `tiny` one, for low memory impact, which doesn't have a translation capability, so the subtitle translations are done using the `google-trans` package. 
The Whisper model is compiled using the [IntelÂ® NPU Acceleration Library](https://github.com/intel/intel-npu-acceleration-library), so that it ultimately runs on the Intel NPU, releaving the CPU or GPU of the processing for a low-powered and efficient inference.

## Content

`./src` : source files of the application

`./media` : various media files used by the project, including a test video file

## Prerequisites

For the application to run properly, install the following prerequisites:
- the [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) media player, as the python package is just an API
- the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) suite for proper handling of video and audio files.

## Installation
The video player runs on the [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) programming language. Testing was done on version 3.10.11.

Package requirements:
```bash
googletrans==3.0.0
PyQt6==6.6.1
torch==1.11.0
intel_npu_acceleration_library==1.0.0
openai-whisper==20231117
python-vlc==3.0.20123
```

Install:
```bash
pip install -r /src/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The app GUI can be started by running the `main.py` file:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

#### Optional Arguments
```bash
options:
  --model {tiny,base,small,medium,large}
                        Whisper-AI model version
  --in_lan {af,sq,am,ar,hy,az,eu,be,bn,bs,bg,ca,ceb,ny,zh-cn,zh-tw,co,hr,cs,da,nl,en...} , default=en
                        Input lanuage of media file
  --out_lan {af,sq,am,ar,hy,az,eu,be,bn,bs,bg,ca,ceb,ny,zh-cn,zh-tw,co,hr,cs,da,nl,en...}, default=en
                        Output language for subtitles
  --gen_sub_file True/False, default=False
                        Generates a subtitle file
```
